# Employee-management-System
You can use this program to realize the increase, deletion, change and check of some employee information.
Here I use Springboot framework for the back-end and thymeleaf for the front-end. After you run this program, you can enter the localhost:9993/emp(The port number i use is 9993)

After you add the employee information, the page will jump to a new page. Here you can see all the employee information and increase or change or delete the employee information.

But in this program, I didn't connect database.Instead, I use HashMap to simulate. In another project, I will show you how to use mybatis to connect to the database suach as mysql.
